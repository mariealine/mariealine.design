# Motorbike
After my job and my extra job activities, motorbike is my hobby.
I builded my own first motorbike at 19 and I rode with during years. Thanks to motorbike, I met some awesome people and someone are now friends.
With some of them we launch the Jeanne Machines crew, and developped a female bikers community : we provide the events, ride for women and give them safe space.
